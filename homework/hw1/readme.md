# Text Classification in Python using the 20 newsgroup dataset

> The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

# Implementation

Classified 20 News-group data into different topics using supervised and unsupervised learning. Implemented using Naive Bayes
Supervised Model - Bernoulli, multinomial, multivariate normal distribution

# Code

The code is pretty straight forward and well documented. The code has been arranged in form of IPython Notebooks, each notebook corresponds to a particular "classifier" or "technique" used for classifying the dataset.

# Requirements

* python 2.7 or above
* python modules:
  * scikit-learn
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
